This is a very simple web app that I made as an exercise using data from my job as a Brand and Social Media Manager at the California Migration Museum. For our recent Melting Spots campaign, I wanted to make a simple app that would return only the social media handles of our various brand partners to simplify the process of drafting posts and searching through an Excel sheet with a lot of information on it. I coded everything in plain HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
